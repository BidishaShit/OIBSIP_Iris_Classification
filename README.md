# Iris Flower Classification
# Project Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on their measurements. The iris dataset is used for training a machine learning model to perform this classification task.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each instance in the dataset is labeled with the species of the iris flower.

The dataset provided by Scikit-learn or download it from this link.

# Model Selection
For this classification task, various machine learning algorithms is used, including Logistic Regression Model,K-nearest Neighbours Model (KNN),Decision Tree Model. The choice of algorithm and its hyperparameters can be explored and tuned in the notebook.

# Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices provide insights into the model's performance on each class.

# Further Improvements
To further improve the model's performance, one can explore techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or using more advanced machine learning algorithms. Additionally, collecting more data or augmenting the existing dataset may also help improve the model's accuracy.
